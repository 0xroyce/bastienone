# Bastien One

<i>What if we already have all that is needed to create helpful and complex autonomous AI bots?</i>

Bastien One is being developed as autonomous A.I. bot with the capacity to complete complex tasks - either by itself or by creating additional specialised bots should it be required.

The goal is to develop ecosystem capable of not only completing simple tasks but also complex tasks, e.g. running a important parts of a business; or creating and running business by itself.

Aim is to release public beta version by end of 2023.

<h2>Overview</h2>

In general, Bastien One is trying to simulate human behaviour in order to achieve goal and provide the best output.

The following is taken into an account in order to achieve best ouput.

<ul>
  <li>Analysis of initial tasks; proposal of an approach to solution</li>
  <li>Self-Criticism of provided solution in order to ensure best initial approach is taken based on known information</li>
  <li>Identification if goal can be achieved by Bastien One with general knowledge or if additional bots with specialised knowledge need to be created</li>
  <li>Prioritisation and tasks management of Bastien One tasks and tasks of bots created by Bastien One</li>
  <li>Access to web to gather information; analysis of inputs - be it written or in image/video format</li>
  <li>Execution of various tasks with different level of complexity</li>
  <li>Collection, completion and summarisation of all outputs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Simplified Flow</h3>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

Since Bastien One needs to have capability to manage tasks with different level of complexity, it will need to create different number of A.I. bots with its own logic and speciality. This will drive increased level of complexity on prioritisation, summarisation and tasks management.

Another challenge is speed - analysis of multiple content (primarily video) could be heavy on resources jeopardising speed. The question about expectations on speed of outcome remains unanswered at the moment. Whilst Bastien One is expected to complete tasks faster and more efficiently than a human, the expectations may be higher.

<h2>Key Elements To Success</h2>

In general, the following key elements have been set for Bastien One to become successful autonomous A.I. bot.

<ul>
  <li>Perception: Be able to gather and interpret/perceived data.</li>
  <li>Cognition: Have the capacity to process, analyze, and understand the gathered data, allowing to make informed decisions.</li>
  <li>Learning: Have the ability to improve performance over time by adapting to new situations and refining decision-making processes.</li>
  <li>Decision-making: Have the capacity to select appropriate actions based on the current situation, goals, and available resources.</li>
  <li>Memory: Have the ability to store and retrieve relevant information, allowing Bastien One to learn from past experiences and apply that knowledge to new situations.</li>
  <li>Communication: Have the ability to interact with other agents or humans.</li>
  <li>Action: Have the capacity to execute selected actions, e.g. accessing and gathering information from web.</li>
  <li>Adaptability: Have the ability to adjust to changes in the environment or task requirements.</li>
  <li>Goal-oriented behavior: Have the ability to set and pursue specific objectives to achieve goal.</li>
  <li>Ethics and safety: Be sure that the AI agent operates within ethical boundaries and does not pose risks to humans or other agents.</li>
</ul>
